Nowadays, a downward trajectory is being observed for the number of people infected with COVID-19 in few regions. This might due to the prevalence of herd immunity in those regions and the recovered patients might have had a role in this. 
                                It can be assumed that the vaccinated people can contribute to herd immunity. The spread of COVID-19 can be monitored and assessed in various clusters after the vaccination of people on a regular basis to contain the spread in an effective way.
                                The objective is to monitor, trace and predict the prevalence of COVID-19, especially in areas having large population, identify the prevalence and point of inflection of herd immunity across various regions having vaccinated people.</p>
